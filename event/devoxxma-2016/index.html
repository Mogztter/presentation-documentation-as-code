Today, I&#8217;m going to talk about how you can improve your documentation process, from writing to delivery, by treating documentation as code.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re talking about here is reusing the tools and process for writing that you&#8217;re already using for software development.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, I want to share my earliest memory of publishing and how it relates to challenges in technical writing today.</p></aside><footer><p class="author"><span class="personname"><span class="firstname">Dan</span> <span class="surname">Allen</span></span><span class="affiliation"><span class="organization">OpenDevise</span></span><span class="contact"><span class="twitter">@mojavelinux</span> </span></p></footer></section>
<section><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/imagewriter-banner.jpg" alt="imagewriter banner"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>My first computer system was an Apple II with an ImageWriter.
Anyone old enough to remember that setup?
It was truly a magical machine of entertainment and possibility.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/print-shop-box.jpg" alt="print shop box"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>Best of all, it came bundled with The Print Shop!</p></aside></section>
<section class="inverse"><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/print-shop-main-menu.gif" alt="print shop main menu"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>My siblings and I went nuts using The Print Shop to make signs and banners and greeting cards.
As a matter of fact, there were a few years there when I thought Hallmark would go out of business because we were making so many birthday cards ourselves.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/skull.svg" alt="skull"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>My go-to pick among the assortment of fonts, graphics, and borders was definitely the skull and crossbones.
I was told after a few times that, while cool, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best choice for birthday cards.
Whatever.
I&#8217;d just go on to use to make that most important of adolescent items: a sign for my bedroom door that read, &#8220;Keep Out!&#8221;</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/imagewriter-banner-long.jpg" alt="imagewriter banner long"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>Using The Print Shop, of course, involved printing.
Back then, we didn&#8217;t all carry around screens in our pockets, so printing was how we&#8217;d share our creations with the world.</p>
<p>Printing those signs, banners, and cards was really my first experience publishing content.
What an amazing sense of power it gave me.
I could write and have those words transformed into something material, tangible, and bigger than what was on the screen.
And my words affected other people.
It was such a thrill.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="video contain"><video src="images/print-shop-printing.mp4" preload="auto" loop="true"><span class="alt">Your browser does not support the video element.</span></video></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>Now, on the practical side of things, printing was <em>not</em> a speedy process.
Once the printer revved up, it would screech and jerk in a flurry of perpetual commotion until the job was complete.
Watching the printer&#8217;s automation was fascinating, but would quickly put you into a trance.
So we&#8217;re talking walk-away-and-come-back-in-an-hour kind of speed.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image"><img src="images/imagewriter-color-ribbon-cartridge.jpg" alt="imagewriter color ribbon cartridge"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>Besides, the printer ribbons only lasted so long and required a special trip to the store to replace.
So my message&#8212;&#8203;my content&#8212;&#8203;had to be chosen wisely for optimum effect and impact, and to keep my parent&#8217;s grievances about using up the ribbon to a minimum.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="image contain"><img src="images/print-shop-thinking.gif" alt="print shop thinking"></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>I also had to share this computer with my siblings.
And you know there&#8217;s nothing more fierce than sibling competition.
We <em>all</em> had something to say and each of us wanted <em>our</em> message to be the one published for the world to see.
Since each print job would completely tie up the computer, we were forced to work together by circumstance.
So this was not only my first publishing experience, but also my first collaborative / argumentative one.</p></aside></section>
<section class="image" style="background-image: url(images/businessmen-pointing.svg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>Technical content today is not far removed from my childhood print shop.
We still have to choose our words wisely.
We must collaborate with others on the creation of that content.
And, of course, seeing our words published out in the world is still just as thrilling.</p>
<p>To get there, we need a content workflow that ensures maximum reuse and facilitates strong collaboration while, at the same time, gives us the flexibility to transform that content however we want and to publish it wherever it needs to go automatically&#8212;&#8203;and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The best way to fulfill all these demands&#8230;&#8203;</p></aside></section>
<section class="axis contrast"><ul><li><span class="primary">Content</span></li><li><span class="primary">Presentation</span></li></ul>
<aside role="note"><p>&#8230;&#8203;is to separate content and presentation.
That way, you can adapt your content to ever-changing stakeholder initiatives and an evolving technology landscape.</p></aside></section>
<section class="agenda"><ul class="build build-items"><li><span class="primary"><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-paint-brush fa-fw"></i></span> Creation</span></li><li><span class="primary"><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-send fa-fw"></i></span> Publication</span></li><li><span class="primary"><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-code-fork fa-fw"></i></span> Collaboration</span></li></ul>
<aside role="note"><p>But there&#8217;s a careful balance that must be achieved to avoid hindering:</p>
<ul><li><span class="primary">creation <em>(reveal)</em>,</span></li><li><span class="primary">publication <em>(reveal)</em>,</span></li><li><span class="primary">or collaboration <em>(reveal)</em>.</span></li></ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a balance I believe Asciidoctor strikes.</p>
<p>In this talk, we&#8217;ll evaluate Asciidoctor through the lens of these three capabilities in order to investigate its viability and its strengths and to learn how to get the most out of it.
Any good content system should score well in all three.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>I&#8217;ll start with the writers in the room.
Rest assured, I&#8217;m with you.</p>
<p>Like you, I believe content is king.
I also believe a content system won&#8217;t be sustainable if it doesn&#8217;t consider the needs of the author first.
Writers need a system that allows them to do what they do best.</p></aside></section>

For the writer, these systems can feel cumbersome, complicated, and downright frustrating.

Yeah, I didn&#8217;t think so.</p>

<section class="subject"><h2>AsciiDoc</h2><aside role="note"><p>We created AsciiDoc as a writer-centric markup system.
And it shows.
The reaction many writers have when they switch to this syntax is, &#8220;I can finally see my content!&#8221;
That speaks volumes.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice about AsciiDoc is that the syntax is clear &amp; concise.
What you see is predominantly content.
It&#8217;s readable in raw form, unlike the other formats we&#8217;ve seen thus far.</p>
<p>Paragraphs are just paragraphs, no bullshit.
The remaining marks are based on familiar conventions, such as leading asterisks to itemize a list, asterisks or underscores around a phrase to emphasize it, and leading equal signs to designate a section title.
Keywords that appear in the syntax are based on common terminology such as <code>image</code>, <code>video</code>, and <code>source</code>.</p>
<p>And the syntax is remarkably forgiving, which makes it less daunting for first timers.</p>
<p>If you dig deeper, you&#8217;ll notice a consistency to the syntax.
That&#8217;s because the language is based on repeatable patterns.
Extensions further build on these patterns, which we&#8217;ll get into later.</p>
<p>Finally, the syntax is extremely semantic.
In fact, AsciiDoc was originally designed as a shorthand for DocBook.
Each bit of content belongs to a node&#8212;&#8203;a content block or phrase.
Nodes can be annotated with extra bits of information that state what the content is, how it might be presented, and other properties.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>The most versatile semantic information is the role.</p>
<p>Roles serve a very important purpose in the AsciiDoc syntax because they allow the writer to pass information to the publisher about the semantics of a node without having to worry how it gets formatted.
The role basically says &#8220;this element has special significance, you deal with it.&#8221;
This abtraction, and other such metadata, is central to achieving the separation of content and presentation.

<aside role="note"><p>Having a syntax that&#8217;s aligned to the left margin helps keeps the writer rooted.
You don&#8217;t have to worry how much indentation you need and content doesn&#8217;t float out into the ether.
Instead, you rely on delimiter lines, or &#8220;fences&#8221; to encompass the content.
AsciiDoc can then assume everything between those lines is content that belongs to that block.</p>
<p>The line-oriented arrangements allows us use the line break to imply meaning.
A line often serves as the boundaries of a node.
Consecutive lines that start with an asterisk, for instance, are clearly items in a list.
A line above a block that starts with a period is the block&#8217;s title.
We do the same thing when writing code.
Each statement gets its own line, so there&#8217;s no need for a semicolon to separate statements.</p></aside></section>
<section><h2>No WYSIWYG?!?</h2><aside role="note"><p>So, what&#8217;s absent here?</p>
<p>WYSIWYG.</p></aside></section>
<section><h2><strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>G</strong>et <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>G</strong>et</h2><div class="build build-items"><h2 class="discrete"><code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></h2></div>
<aside role="note"><p>But is it really a problem?
Yeah, I don&#8217;t think so.
WYSIWYG places a barrier between you and your content and robs you of a lot of control.
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s an all too familiar input mechanism in a CMS.
We should really call a CMS a content lobotomy system, or CLS.
Instead of suiting your needs, it <em>seemingly</em> solves your problem by making it impossible to do what you want to do.
I like to say, &#8220;You Get What You Get.&#8221;</p></aside></section>
<section><h2>IDE for Writers</h2><aside role="note"><p>I do believe tools such as Atom can go much further&#8230;&#8203;maturing into a full blown IDE for writers.

<aside role="note"><p>Using a text editor such as Atom with the appropriate add-ons, you can see the final product in a preview pane.
As you can change, embellish, or restructure the document, you can see what the end result is going to look like in real time.</p></aside></section>
<section><header><h2>Creation</h2><h3>Recommended Practices</h3></header><aside role="note"><p>AsciiDoc has a rich syntax, with many, <em>many</em> built-in elements and options to organize and annotate your content.
You shouldn&#8217;t expect to learn it all in one day.
But you also don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>Most shops gravitate towards a subset of the markup.
Dialects, particularly using roles, naturally emerge that bring additional consistency and reinforce the impression of simplicity.
You can prepare templates for common document types to help give writers an easy starting point.</p></aside></section>

----</code></pre>
<aside role="note"><p>Another way to simplify writing with AsciiDoc is to partition large documents.
For instance, you can split up the source of a book along chapter divisions.
You can also import common content or extracted code samples so they don&#8217;t clutter the writer&#8217;s view.
AsciiDoc supports all this through its include mechanism.
You can even include portions of another document by selecting the snippets by line number or tag.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Now that the content is encoded in AsciiDoc, who does the writer hand it off to and what can be done with it?</p>
<p>The AsciiDoc syntax is so simple and elegant, it&#8217;s easy to be deceived that it can only produce primitive output.
That couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.
The AsciiDoc content is just the raw material and its semantics are the seeds of the blossoms we&#8217;ll produce.
This is where engineers get to work their magic.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s shed some light on how we can transform it and where we can publish it.
It&#8217;s the dawn of endless possibilities, just like The Print Shop was for me as a child.</p></aside></section>

Asciidoctor is the processor.</p>

<section><h2>Transformation <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-random fa-fw"></i></span></h2><aside role="note"><p>The bridge to get from content to presentation&#8212;&#8203;you might even say the magic trick&#8212;&#8203;is transformation.
Transformation is the key to being able to publish to a variety of formats and variants of those formats.
Let&#8217;s dive into how transformation works.</p>
<p>When Asciidoctor reads in the file, it builds an AST, short for abstract syntax tree.
That tree gets passed to a converter, which then transforms the structure into a target format, such as HTML, or some application of HTML, like slides.
This presentation, in fact, is the product of that transformation.</p>
<p>One way to extend Asciidoctor is to write a custom converter&#8212;&#8203;as was used for this presentation&#8212;&#8203;or tweak one that already exists by supplying custom templates.
The only limit to what output formats you can produce is what you&#8217;re willing and able to create.</p>
<p>Even before the tree is sent to the converter, you have a chance to manipulate it using a tree processor.
In fact, you don&#8217;t even have to output anything.
You can just use the AST to query the document for information in a contextual way (unlike grep, which is crude and blind to context).</p>
<p>You can go a step further and enhance the parser itself.
Asciidoctor provides an extension API for introducing additional elements into the syntax, such as a custom block or macro.
This is where things gets really exciting.</p>
<p><mark>TODO talk about lorem block macro example</mark></p>
<p>As you can see, you have a lot of control over how the AsciiDoc is interpreted.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that one input document produces one output document.
The integration of multiple sources of content into numerous publishing targets is one of the key strengths of Asciidoctor.</p>
<p>For example, you can take one input document that represents a book and produce multiple pages of HTML.
Reasonable enough.
Or, you can use the processor, or a toolchain that wraps it, to weave together input from several sources.</p>
<p>We see this technique used in API documentation tools like Spring REST Docs and swagger2markup, which generate AsciiDoc to document the API methods, then combine that generated content with content written by the author to form a final document (or documents) to be published.
You can also weave in content that gets derived from the source code, such as a configuration property table.
Part generated, part scribed.</p></aside></section>
<section><figure class="quote"><blockquote><p>I can do truly amazing things with my AsciiDoc source.</p></blockquote><figcaption>Scott Chacon <cite>author of Pro Git</cite></figcaption></figure>
<aside role="note"><p>This transformation capability also prevents lock-in.
Just as you can generate formats for publishing, you can convert to another source format, even AsciiDoc itself.
There truly are endless possibilities for your content once it&#8217;s in the AsciiDoc format and fed into this toolchain.</p></aside></section>

<section><h2>Push to Publish</h2><aside role="note"><p>Processing doesn&#8217;t end with Asciidoctor.
The whole publication phase should be managed by a build and fully automated.
Just like in our childhood print shop, once we sent our masterpiece to the printer, it took over publishing from there.
I like to call this &#8220;push to publish.&#8221;
It&#8217;s the modern day &#8220;send it off to the printer.&#8221;
We&#8217;re also borrowing a page from development by implementing continuous delivery for the documentation.</p>
<p>Treat your docs just like you would any other application.
These automated builds also aid with collaboration, which we&#8217;ll launch into next.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>We&#8217;ve arrived at the final section of this talk: collaboration.
This section addresses both the writers and the engineers, as well as anyone else who must work side-by-side to produce technical content.
This is where the harmony of writing and delivery comes together.</p>
<p>AsciiDoc lends itself well to collaboration because many of the tools needed to collaborate on it are already in place in a development shop.
In particular, AsciiDoc is ripe for collaboration because it&#8217;s source control friendly.</p></aside></section>

<section><h2>git <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-heart"></i></span> AsciiDoc</h2><aside role="note"><p>AsciiDoc doesn&#8217;t specifically have &#8220;source control support.&#8221;
Instead, it simply lends itself to being source controlled.
No binary blobs, just plain text.
And source control systems like git just <em>love</em> plain text.
You get history, source diffs, rich diffs, branching, merging, etc., all which can be managed through interfaces like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.</p></aside></section>
<section><h2><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></span> <span class="underline">Edit on GitHub</span></h2><aside role="note"><p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the significance of GitHub (and, increasingly, GitLab) for collaboration.
These interfaces have proven to be incredibly approachable and to encourage contribution.</p>
<p>Nothing is a stronger force for inviting participation than an &#8220;Edit on GitHub&#8221; link in your docs.
It presents any page as editable, yet funnels the contributor into a web-based content review workflow based on git.
The web-based editor recognizes AsciiDoc and can show a preview of it.</p>
<p>As an aside, if you take this route, I strongly recommend investing in git training.
Everyone on the team needs to understand how the git workflow behind the &#8220;Edit on GitHub&#8221; link works to truly benefit from it.
And, trust me, knowing how to use git correctly will save time and toes.</p></aside></section>

It&#8217;s for writing in some sort of markup language that you can edit on the web.
We have all the advantages of a wiki, like Wikipedia, but it&#8217;s also backed by git.
You can benefit from the social coding phenomenon simply by moving your documentation to one of these platforms.</p>
<p>All this leads to a strong-held belief of ours.
Docs = Code.</p>
<p>We have a long history in this industry of collaborating on code.
If we view documentation as just another form of code, we can use code collaboration processes, practices, techniques, and tools to benefit our documentation.
Strength building on strength for a solid end product.</p></aside></section>

<section><header><h2>Collaboration</h2><h3>Recommended Practices</h3></header><aside role="note"><p>While AsciiDoc is naturally friendly to source control systems, there are some things you can do to optimize collaboration.</p>
<p>Try to keep changes isolated.
One way to do this is by writing using the sentence-per-line method.
Changes to a sentence do not affect the sentences around it (much like code), and therefore prevents people from step on each other&#8217;s commits.</p>
<p>You also don&#8217;t want documents that are too large, so modularize your content and break up monolithic documents.
People can then work on different parts of the documentation without having to coordinate.
As mentioned earlier, import non-content such as code snippets so it can be managed independently and kept up to date.</p>
<p>Use validation tools to catch writing errors early and drastically cut down on expense micro-migrations to fix these mistakes.
It helps to have a style guide so information is organized consistently without having to do a lot of personal training.</p>
<p>Use an issue tracker to manage bugs, improvements, and content initiatives.
You can then see content progress as it moves across the issue board.
Mention the issue when submitting the pull request that resolves it.
Just like code.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to manage different versions of a document using branches so you can take advantage of the tools the source control system gives you.
To help with this, organize your repositories by software product or logical product group.
Then, have a branch for each major release line.
If different documents have different versioning schemes, or move at different rates, that&#8217;s an indicator you should move them to separate repositories.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you structure and organize the content, anyone coming along should be able to build the output through a simple interface, without having to remember complex commands.
This is the role of an automated &#8220;development&#8221; build.
It makes the documentation approachable and allows contributors to verify the changes they make improve the product in the way they expect (and not the opposite).
The documentation can also be staged for review by different groups.</p></aside></section>

<aside role="note"><p>Today, we evaluated Asciidoctor through the lens of three capabilities: creation; publication; and collaboration.
In each case, it&#8217;s proven to meet the needs of the respective stakeholders, which is essential for forming a robust content system.</p>
<p>With AsciiDoc, writers are able to write with minimal interference from bloated markup and needless structure.
They can focus on the words, the ideas, and the messages that reach millions of users across the globe, or just the person in the next cubicle, all because the content is separate from the presentation.</p>
<p>Engineers are empowered too since documentation is just another form of code.
They can use Asciidoctor to transform the AsciiDoc and completely customize the generated output.
<mark>This is critical since content that&#8217;s locked away cannot serve its function, and cannot reach its users across channels.</mark></p>
<p>Finally, both writers and engineers&#8212;&#8203;as well as anyone else involved in the end product&#8212;&#8203;can collaborate in a systematic, streamlined way that eliminates duplicated effort and headaches.
Like the technology it documents, technical writing benefits from many eyes and minds as anything inherently complex does.
This is a system that welcomes their particiaption.
It fuels collaboration, encouraging contributions to make good content great.</p>
<p>The Asciidoctor toolchain, from the AsciiDoc language to the Asciidoctor processor, extensions, and tools, brings all these ideas into one.
While there&#8217;s a bit more assembly required up front, I&#8217;m confident you&#8217;ll find treating documentation as code will drastically improve your documentation workflow and, as a result, the quality of your content.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></aside></section>
